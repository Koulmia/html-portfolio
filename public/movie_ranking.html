<h1>My Favourite Gentle Movies</h1>

<h2>Sometimes a movie should be a warm embrace, soothing you after a tiring day; or offering comfort in times of sickness and emotional distress. <br /><br />These are my top three.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>

<p>I watch this whenever I am hungover.</p>

<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>

<p>The chicken soup of films.</p>

<h3>Labyrinth</h3>

<p>My favourite film of all time.  It connects me to my childhood, I appreciate 
    the puppetry.  David Bowie.  Goblins... </p>
    
<p>I love it.</p>  
<p>I watch it when I feel sad, I watch it when I want to feel brave, 
I watch it when I want to reconnect to my inner child.</p>

<p>Also, David Bowie.</p>
