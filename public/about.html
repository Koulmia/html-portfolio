<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a full-time Computer Science/Psychology Student with the Open University.  I spent the last 20 years working backstage in theatre,
   installing and fault finding lighting and sound systems, programming moving lights, networking control consoles, building special effects, 
   and having just a little too much fun with pyrotechnics.  Though its early days, academically speaking, I am loving my studies.  So much so that I 
  am supplementing Uni with as much as I can realistically manage.  At the time of writing this bio, I'm taking a full stack-web development course, 
and studying for CCSK and CompTIA Sec+ certification.    </p>


<p>In the rare moments when I do have a spot of time to myself, I enjoy dressmaking, firespinning, writing bad folk-punk fiction,
  and playing drums with my local community drum crew.
